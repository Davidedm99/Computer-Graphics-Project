# Computer-Graphics-Project
This is a project made by me and [Giacomo Dell'Agosto](https://github.com/GiacomoDA) for the Computer Graphics course AY 2022/2023. <br>
The projects consists in the rendering of a rocket ship able to move in a defined space with parabolic shape. The asset for the rocket were given by the Professor while the 
ground was made with Blender and the textures for the ground and the skybox were made in Photoshop. <br>
Those texture are not the best since they were not required in the project description, but they can definetly be improved.

## Import in Vulkan
To make the project work you may simply download the project using the "<> Code" button and select the "download Zip" option and then open with Visual Studio the
[.Solution file](https://github.com/Davidedm99/Computer-Graphics-Project/blob/master/working%20rocket.sln). <br>
If this is not working for you, you might check the Vulkan tutorial and setup the environment in order to make everything work fine, you can follow the installation guide
